# Java-Bundle-Project
A project that tests my understanding of Java lists, dictionaries and stacks.


This program was a part of a bundle questionnire I got during my studies of Java.
It has 3 different questions with different purposes.


1. The first question gets a list of parties that participates in an election, every string in the list is a vote by a citizen. 
The function I was asked to make prints out the amount of parties that didn't passed the number 'hasima' (Translates to blocking, which is the minimum number of votes needed to pass).
If none of the parties passed the blocking number, it will return 0, else, it prints the parties according to the number of votes (And alphabetical order if some parties have the same amount of votes).
It also returns the party with the largest amount of votes.

2. The second question tested my understanding of lists and interfaces. I made a generic interface that compares between custom objects. This interface has a function named MinMax which tests which objects are 'bigger', according to the parameters that are desired.
3. I also have an example in the main section.


3. The third question was to test my knowledge of dictionaries, it gets a collection of objects and returns a map of them, which represents the rarity of each object. The value is the rarity.
Main also has an example
 
 Have fun!
